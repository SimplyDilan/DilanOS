          “After another moment's silence she mumbled that I was peculiar, that that was probably why she loved me but that one day I might disgust her for the very same reason.”
          <br><br>
          “And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.” (A. Camus, 'The Stranger')
          <br><br>
          “I was assailed by memories of a life that wasn't mine anymore, but one in which I'd found the simplest and most lasting joys. (A. Camus, 'The Stranger')
          <br><br>
          "We tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn't always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away." (A. Camus, 'The Plague')
          <br><br>
          “Like a dog!" he said, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.” (F. Kafka, 'The Trial')
          <br><br>
          “I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man." (F. Dostoevsky, 'Notes From the Underground')
          <br><br>
         “As if this great outburst of anger had purged all my ills, killed all my hopes, I looked up at the mass of signs and stars in the night sky and laid myself open for the first time to the benign indifference of the world- and finding it so much like myself, in fact so fraternal, I realized that I’d been happy, and that I was still happy. For the final consummation and for me to feel less lonely, my last wish was that there should be a crowd of spectators at my execution and that they should greet me with cries of hatred.” (A. Camus, 'The Stranger')
         <br><br>
         “Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about. In my prison, when the sky turned red and a new day slipped into my cell, I found out that she was right.” (A. Camus, 'The Stranger')
         <br><br>
         "“I know simply that the sky will last longer than I.” (A. Camus, 'The Myth Of The Sisyphus')
         <br><br>
         “What am I doing in this eternal winter?” (F. Kafka, 'A Country Doctor')
         <br><br>
         “Manuscripts don't burn!" (Mikhail Bulgakov, 'Master and Margarita')
         <br><br>
         “Since I met you, I've felt abandoned without your nearness; your nearness is all I ever dream of, the only thing.” (F. Kafka, 'The Castle')
         <br><br>
         “But what can be done, the one who loves must share the fate of the one he loves.” (Mikhail Bulgakov, 'Master and Margarita')
         <br><br>
         “Just like a murderer jumps out of nowhere in an alley, love jumped out in front of us and struck us both at once." (Mikhail Bulgakov, 'Master and Margarita')
         <br><br>
         “You misinterpret everything, even the silence.” (F. Kafka, 'The Castle')
         <br><br>
         “I'll go to bed, forget myself in sleep.” (Mikhail Bulgakov, 'Master and Margarita')
