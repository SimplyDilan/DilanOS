  <h1>Castle On a Hill</h1>
<p>
A time of repent, The Renaissance<br>
In a quaint town resides a convalescent man.
<br>No job. No family. No crown.<br>
His luck had run out.<br><br>
Impious, yet he sat on a throne <br>Waiting for that castle to fall, <br>Turn to dust beneath him<br>
The man who spread false prophecies,<br>
Genuflects before the altar<br> 
He had been cast to perdition<br>
No longer would he drink from his golden chalice<br><br>
In a cloud of illness,<br>
The plague brought many to the underground
<br>Who else resides in these streets besides the cold? <br>
A serpent slithers below the peasant’s feet<br><br>
The King has fallen,<br>
And so, man ceased to exist.<br><br>
<h1>Castle On A Hill II</h1><p><br>
The glistening of a star in the quiet sky, 
<br>The stinging pain in his left eye<br>
For how long he must live in anticipation 
<br>Of when it will sting again?<br>
Plagued by a lifetime of sleepless nights <br>He reached out a hand only to find
<br>Whatever he wished for,<br>
Was long out of his grasp<br><br>
All that was left was the silence<br>
That suffocated him<br>
A depraved and unforgiving silence,<br>
Yet he wouldn't utter a word of opposition <br>And the pain began to sting even more, <br>
And he was finally silenced,<br>
Just as he thought he would live forever<br>
But he was no more than a speck of dust in the great wind<br>
Which swept him off the face of the earth.</p><br><br>
   <br>   
  </body>
